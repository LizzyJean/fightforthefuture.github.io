        <title>Nearly 100,000 Internet users call for Copyright Office to improve Fair Use and Free Speech protections in DMCA</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;br/&gt;April 4, 2016&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flood of comments from viral campaign and YouTube video launched by Fight for the Future and Channel Awesome crashed regulations.gov website last week&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hours to go before the U.S. copyright office’s deadline to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151231/16544133215/us-copyright-office-asks-public-comments-dmcas-notice-takedown.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;receive comments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA&amp;rsquo;s) “notice and takedown” process, digital rights group&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and popular YouTube channel&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiH828EtgQjTyNIMH6YiOSw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ChannelAwesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;launched an online campaign and viral video encouraging Internet users to submit comments about the many ways that the DMCA is abused to censor and take down legitimate content from the Internet, stifling innovation, cultural creation, and freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the online campaign here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://takedownabuse.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TakedownAbuse.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the video here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NoIL5qUI1p8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/NoIL5qUI1p8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign was launched late Thursday afternoon. As Monday morning the video has already been viewed more than &lt;b&gt;360,000 times&lt;/b&gt;. The campaign has already generated more than &lt;b&gt;86,000&lt;/b&gt; comments before the Copyright Office’s Friday deadline, and has since collected an additional &lt;b&gt;11,000&lt;/b&gt;, which will be delivered to the Copyright Office as a petition. The comments are in support of stronger fair use and free speech protections in the DMCA. Before the launch of the campaign last week, the Copyright Office had only received 80 (yes, eighty) comments. As of March 2nd, they had &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=COLC-2015-0013-0001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flood of new submissions late last week&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/VP8n5a0.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repeatedly crashed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=COLC-2015-0013-0002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that the government set up to receive feedback. Given that this site is the only method for concerned Internet users to submit comments, Fight for the Future is calling on the Copyright Office to consider the additional comments that came in after the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DMCA affects all Internet users and they should have an opportunity to express their concerns with the ways content is censored from the Internet, causing damage to free speech that can&amp;rsquo;t be undone,” &lt;b&gt;said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“The Copyright Office has a responsibility to make sure these voices are heard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Copyright laws are among the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the digital age,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. &lt;/b&gt;“Taking down content from the Internet en masse doesn’t benefit artists and individual creators, it benefits large corporations. I supported my family as a musician for years before coming to Fight for the Future, and I believe creators should be compensated for their work. But the Internet is the best thing to ever happen to creative people and independent artists. We need to fight to defend it from those pushing censorship in our names,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;We need to have real open discussions on how to adapt copyright law and the DMCA to account for the modern Internet,&amp;rdquo; &lt;b&gt;said Michael Michaud, who made the video for ChannelAwesome, &lt;/b&gt;“While we&amp;rsquo;re sure the DMCA is being used the right way at times, it&amp;rsquo;s also being used to silence speech, hold videos hostage, steal, and destroy content creators.  It&amp;rsquo;s also being used by companies that fail to account for Fair Use.&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Fight for the Future&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for breaking updates on this campaign, and contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to schedule an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit with more than 1.4 million members that works to defend the Internet as an open and powerful platform for freedom of expression.

        <title>Copyright censorship is no joke. YouTubers and other Internet users deluge Copyright Office with 50,000 comments to fix the DMCA</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;br/&gt;April 1st, 2016 (not a joke)&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flood of comments crashes regulations.gov server, Fight for the Future calls on Copyright Office to extend deadline to ensure all comments are received&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hours to go before the U.S. copyright office’s deadline to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151231/16544133215/us-copyright-office-asks-public-comments-dmcas-notice-takedown.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;r&lt;b&gt;eceive comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA&amp;rsquo;s) “notice and takedown” process, digital rights group&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and popular YouTube channel &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiH828EtgQjTyNIMH6YiOSw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ChannelAwesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have launched an online campaign and viral video encouraging Internet users to submit comments about the many ways that the DMCA is abused to censor and take down legitimate content from the Internet, stifling innovation, cultural creation, and freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the online campaign here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://takedownabuse.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TakedownAbuse.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the video here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NoIL5qUI1p8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/NoIL5qUI1p8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign was launched late Thursday afternoon. The video has already been viewed more than&lt;b&gt; 170,000 times&lt;/b&gt;, and the campaign has already generated more than &lt;b&gt;50,000 comments&lt;/b&gt; in support of stronger fair use and free speech protections in the DMCA. Before the launch of the campaign last night, the Copyright Office had only received 80 (yes, eighty) comments.

Given that this site is the only method for concerned Internet users to submit comments, Fight for the Future is calling on the Copyright Office to extend its deadline to ensure that all comments are received and there is adequate time for the public participation. The tens of thousands of comments submitted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://takedownabuse.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;TakedownAbuse.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are being stored in a queue, and will be submitted to the Copyright Office’s form as quickly as they can reliably receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DMCA affects all Internet users and they should have an opportunity to express their concerns with the ways content is censored from the Internet, causing damage to free speech that can&amp;rsquo;t be undone,” &lt;b&gt;said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future,&lt;/b&gt; “The Copyright Office has a responsibility to make sure these voices are heard. They need to extend the deadline and make sure their website stays up and can receive comments the entire time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Copyright laws are among the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the digital age,”&lt;b&gt; said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.&lt;/b&gt; “Taking down content from the Internet en masse doesn’t benefit artists and individual creators, it benefits large corporations.

        <title>Fight for the Future condemns Internet Association’s support for TPP</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;br/&gt;March 30, 2016&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trade group representing Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Netflix endorses non-transparent, anti-user agreement that promotes censorship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Internet Association, a trade group representing major web companies including Google, Twitter, and Facebook, endorsed the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP). Leading digital rights group Fight for the Future launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/2016/ia-tpp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;online campaign&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in response, calling for the companies to drop their misguided support, and issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is when we find out which tech companies really support their users’ basic rights and which ones are only pretending to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TPP is an anti-user, anti-Internet agreement. It was negotiated in almost complete secrecy by corporate lobbyists and government bureaucrats––including the ones who pushed Internet censorship bills like SOPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TPP exports the worst parts of the United States’ broken copyright system without ensuring protections for freedom of expression, innovation, and human rights. It’s great for incumbent monopolies, but terrible for individual Internet users, startups, and the tech community as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call on all member companies of the Internet Association to disavow this misguided position and stand with their users. Secretive trade agreements are unacceptable venues for making policy that affects billions of Internet users. The customers of these companies expect and deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; Moments before Fight for the Future launched its campaign, reddit, one of the most popular sites on the Internet and a member of the Internet Association, issued &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reddit/status/715349463628288002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;distancing themselves from the association’s position, saying they do not support the TPP. reddit has supported Fight for the Future’s campaigns against the TPP in the past. Cloud-computing firm Salesforce also confirmed in an email to Fight for the Future that they have not taken an official position on the TPP, casting doubt that there is consensus in support of Internet Association’s statement even among its member companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future is a digital rights non-profit best known for organizing some of the&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sopastrike.com/numbers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;online protests in history including the massive Internet blackout against SOPA, the&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/infographic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Slowdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for net neutrality, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://resetthenet.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reset the Net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; campaign against government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Fight for the Future organized a fierce &lt;a href=&quot;http://youbetrayedus.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;online backlash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tech companies who signed on to a letter endorsing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA,) which lead to many of those companies &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dropping support&lt;/a&gt; for the bill, including Salesforce, Apple, Dropbox, and Google. Later, the group released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131615744438/fight-for-the-future-launches-corporate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;scorecard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; grading companies based on their positions on privacy and security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future has been active in campaigning against the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, helping organize the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stopfasttrack.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;StopFastTrack.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;coalition that successfully delayed the passage of Trade Promotion Authority legislation, bringing together a unique group of tech companies, unions, environmental groups, and others opposing the secretive trade deal. The group even captured headlines when it flew a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/113511626098/breaking-internet-activists-are-flying-a-30-foot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;30’ blimp&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for the Senator to drop his support for Fast Tracking the TPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>If the FBI doesn’t tell Apple how they hacked the San Bernardino iPhone, they’re putting lives at risk</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;March 30, 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/141865782913/fbi-backs-down-after-public-outcry-opens-san&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public outcry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about the dangers of government-mandated backdoors, the FBI backed down and opened the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone without Apple’s help. If they really care about public safety, they must disclose the vulnerability they used to Apple to prevent criminals, hackers, and terrorists from exploiting the same security flaw and using it to do harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encryption protects our hospitals, airports, power plants, and water treatment facilities. Sensitive information about critical infrastructure is stored on phones, computers, and in the cloud. The only thing preventing it from falling into the wrong hands is strong security technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Influencers/2016/0324/Influencers-FBI-should-disclose-San-Bernardino-iPhone-security-hole-to-Apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;agree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that when a government agency discovers a security flaw that it can exploit for surveillance purposes, the best thing to do is to disclose that flaw to the company so that it can fix it for future products. That’s because vulnerabilities are never just used by law enforcement. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://betanews.com/2015/03/03/what-the-freak-huge-ssl-security-flaw-stems-from-us-government-backdoor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/12/juniper-networks-hidden-backdoors-show-the-risk-of-government-backdoors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, security flaws that were created or hoarded by agencies like the FBI and NSA have been used by criminal hackers and foreign governments to carry out attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the White House agrees, and has created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-nsa-odni-vulnerabilities-foia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;a program&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically for the government to share vulnerabilities in cases exactly like this. But so far, the FBI is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/feds-mum-if-they-will-disclose-how-fbi-got-data-from-seized-iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dodging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the question, and won’t say whether they’ll do the right thing here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI claimed to the court at least &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/22/dojs-pre-ass-handing-capitulation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;19 times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that there was no way they could unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter without forcing Apple to build a government backdoor into their operating system. They maintained this repeatedly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/hearing/the-encryption-tightrope-balancing-americans-security-and-privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Under oath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;consensus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among security experts is that this was never true; the FBI misled the court and the public in pursuit of a dangerous precedent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that they’ve opened the iPhone in question, the mainstream media is already speculating as to how they did it. And it goes without saying that hackers, other governments, and those wishing to exploit this security flaw to do harm to the public are already hard at work trying to figure it out. Worse, the FBI has a terrible track record of protecting it’s own data. Just recently they &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hacker-publishes-personal-info-of-20000-fbi-agents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;leaked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; personal information about more than 20,000 FBI agents. They’re clearly not capable of keeping this exploit from falling into the wrong hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only responsible thing for the FBI to do to protect all of our safety and security is to disclose the method they used to Apple so they can fix it and make sure it can’t be used to carry out future attacks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change. They’re best known for organizing the massive online protests against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against government surveillance.

        <title>FBI backs down after public outcry, opens San Bernardino iPhone without Apple’s help after repeatedly claiming that was impossible</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The FBI’s credibility just hit a new low,” says Fight for the Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;br/&gt;March 28, 2016&lt;br/&gt;|Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI says it has unlocked the iPhone in the San Bernardino case without Apple’s help. This breaking news should not come as a surprise; the consensus among credible technical experts has always been that there were multiple ways the FBI could attempt to bypass the phone’s security, and that the government’s goal in its legal fight with Apple was not to access the data on the phone but rather to set a precedent to compel private companies to build backdoors into their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FBI’s credibility just hit a new low,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,&lt;/b&gt; “They repeatedly lied to the court and the public in pursuit of a dangerous precedent that would have made all of us less safe. Fortunately, Internet users mobilized quickly and powerfully to educate the public about the dangers of backdoors, and together we forced the government to back down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will go down in history as one of the FBI’s biggest public relations failures,” &lt;b&gt;added Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future,&lt;/b&gt; “It couldn’t be clearer that they read the tea leaves, saw they were going to lose both in the court of law and the court of public opinion, and gave up, for now at least.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/a&gt;, a digital rights group known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history, was behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/141500788643/photos-fbi-reverses-course-in-fight-with-apple-as&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#SaveSecurity&lt;/a&gt; campaign that set up a battery powered flat-screen TV outside last week’s cancelled Apple vs FBI hearing to display more than 20,000 comments collected at SaveSecurity.org, a campaign site that was supported on social media by major web firms including reddit, Wikimedia, and Google. The same group was behind nearly 50 rapid response &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-02-23-photos-protesters-at-apple-stores-in-40-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; outside Apple stores and FBI headquarters last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ publicly claimed at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/22/dojs-pre-ass-handing-capitulation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;19 times&lt;/a&gt; that there was no other viable method to open Sayed Farook’s iPhone other than with Apple’s help. This was a core tenet of their case using the All Writs Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before this latest announcement, multiple expert security researchers have cast serious doubt on the DOJ’s claim that only Apple could help unlock the phone. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/how-the-fbi-could-use-acid-and-lasers-to-access-data-stored-on-seized-iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/03/08/snowden-fbi-claim-that-only-apple-can-unlock-phone-is-bullshit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The DOJ is probably lying about its latest claim in the Apple vs FBI case</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;684&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;968&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://41.media.tumblr.com/df63ab0b67f46b58cd00a010f32f626f/tumblr_inline_o4i9a2ea3X1ri3xd7_540.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;684&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;968&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI probably lied this week when they said they just discovered a way to hack the San Bernardino iPhone without Apple&amp;rsquo;s help.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several outlets are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-cellebrite-idUSKCN0WP17J&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the “3rd party” who supposedly just approached the FBI offering to help hack the iPhone at the center of the Apple vs FBI case is Israeli security firm Cellebrite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ publicly claimed at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/22/dojs-pre-ass-handing-capitulation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;19 times&lt;/a&gt; that there was no other viable method to open Sayed Farook’s iPhone other than with Apple’s help. This was a core tenet of their case using the All Writs Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But surveillance blogger Marcy Wheeler points out that the DOJ was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/23/on-february-16-doj-got-a-warrant-to-open-an-iphone-6-using-cellebrite/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already in talks&lt;/a&gt; with Cellebrite about hacking an iPhone 6 in a drug case as long ago as February 16th. Cellebrite is a well-known firm used by many law enforcement agencies, and it publicly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesofisrael.com/how-israels-cellebrite-could-unlock-the-san-bernadino-iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;boasts&lt;/a&gt; on its website about its ability to hack Apple products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ never mentioned Cellebrite as an alternative possibility in its filings with the court. In this case, that omission essentially amounts to lying. They consistently claimed that there was simply no other way to break into the phone without Apple’s help, even though they knew there was another very plausible possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before this latest announcement, multiple expert security researchers have cast serious doubt on the DOJ’s claim that only Apple could help unlock the phone. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/how-the-fbi-could-use-acid-and-lasers-to-access-data-stored-on-seized-iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/03/08/snowden-fbi-claim-that-only-apple-can-unlock-phone-is-bullshit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems really worth digging into. It really looks like the FBI is backing down from this fight because they realized they were losing public trust and weren’t going get the precedent they were after. It’s important that the public understand what really happened here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI’s last minute excuse is about as believable as an undergrad who comes down with the flu the night before their paper is due. They should come clean immediately, and admit that they mislead the court and the public, to avoid further damaging what’s left of their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For comment, contact press@fightforthefure.org &lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was a grab for power,” &lt;b&gt;said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“The FBI already had the capability to hack this phone using forensic tools, but they thought this case would be a slam dunk––a way for them to set a dangerous precedent that they’ve wanted for years. Instead, it appears they’re running away with their tail between their legs, trying to save face while they go. They knew they were going to lose, both in the court of law and the court of public opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FBI might be running away from their own hearing, but we’re not,” &lt;b&gt;said Jeff Lyon, Chief Technology Officer at Fight for the Future, the group that collected the comments. &lt;/b&gt;“We’ll still be outside the courthouse to make sure those people’s voices are heard, because this fight is far from over.

Activists will be present outside the court during this entire time, showing the thousands of comments comments on a digital display and reading them aloud, while carrying banners and signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://savesecurity.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;#SaveSecurity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; campaign is being coordinated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the digital rights group known for organizing many of the largest Web-based protests in history. The same group was behind nearly 50 rapid response &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-02-23-photos-protesters-at-apple-stores-in-40-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;outside Apple stores and FBI headquarters last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is not just about one phone, it’s about the future of safety and security for millions of people all over the world,” s&lt;b&gt;aid Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,&lt;/b&gt; “We’ll be outside the courthouse to make sure those people’s voices are heard, because what the government is trying to do in this case doesn’t just threaten our basic rights, it puts all of us in danger. Encryption protects our hospitals, airports, and water treatment facilities. Undermining security risks lives.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACLU attorney Alex Abdo added, &lt;/b&gt;“The outcome of this case could not be more important for the future of privacy and security in the digital age. If the FBI wins, it will have gained the power to force the tech companies to hack their customers. This is a reckless pursuit that threatens to undermine the security of all our devices, not just the one phone at issue in the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters who gathered outside of Apple stores and FBI headquarters last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-02-23-photos-protesters-at-apple-stores-in-40-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;carried&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; giant iPhone shaped banners with the message “Secure Phones Save Lives,” echoing the concerns of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/03/469091056/tech-companies-security-experts-express-support-for-apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;security experts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who largely agree that backdoors in encryption technology actually weaken national security and undermine public safety rather than strengthen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fight for the Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is best known for organizing some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; online protests in history, including the SOPA blackout against online censorship, &lt;a href=&quot;http://resetthenet.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reset the Net&lt;/a&gt; to promote encryption and fight government surveillance, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://battleforthenet.com/infographic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Slowdown&lt;/a&gt; for net neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future expert staff are available for interviews about the #SaveSecurity campaign and the broader implications of the Apple vs. FBI court case. &lt;b&gt;Contact: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press@fightforthefuture.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The group, which was behind nearly 50 rapid response &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-02-23-photos-protesters-at-apple-stores-in-40-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;protests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; outside Apple stores and FBI headquarters last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group will have volunteers outside the U.S. District Court on Tuesday to digitally display the thousands of comments, and read them aloud. The goal of the campaign is to educate the public and decision-makers in Washington, DC about the dangers associated with encryption backdoors and real implications of weakening digital security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See the new online campaign here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.savesecurity.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://wwwSaveSecurity.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals, organizations, and companies will be able to show support for the campaign and join the online outcry against the FBI’s attack on security by changing their social media avatar or website logo to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://savesecurity.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“lock” symbol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reminding the government and the public that strong security measures like encryption are saving lives every day. Tweets to the hashtag #SaveSecurity that contain comments related to the case will also be displayed and read aloud outside the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is not just about one phone, it’s about the future of safety and security for millions of people all over the world,” s&lt;b&gt;aid Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, &lt;/b&gt;“We’ll be outside the courthouse to make sure those people’s voices are heard, because what the government is trying to do in this case doesn’t just threaten our basic rights, it puts all of us in danger.
